        <h2>Forsyth County, Georgia-1912</h2>
            <p>Again, residential segregation was far from an occurrence of happenstance or uncoerced reasoning. In many ways, racial segregation was violent.</p>
   
            <p>In response to two incidents - the alleged rape of a white woman by a black man and the rape and beating of a white woman who later died of her injuries,  a white mob lynched 3 black men. Nightriders {a member of a secret band of mounted men who committed nocturnal acts of violence and intimidation against blacks in the southern US during Reconstruction} drove out the entire black population. Its reputation might have a lot to do with the few black residents in Forsyth county.</p>

            <p>In 1990 .3% of Forsyth County’s population was African American</p>

        <h2>Sundown Towns</h2>
            <p>Similarly, there were and still are, places called Sundown towns in the United States.  These are towns that had signs that warned African Americans to leave the towns before the sunsets. These towns are notorious for their violence against black people to keep their communities all white. Martinsville Indiana is one of these towns.</p>
            <p>In 1968, a young African American girl named Carol Jenkins was stabbed to death for selling encyclopedias after dark. Information from the 2019 census data revealed that black residents make up 1.3% of this city of over 11 thousand people. </p>

        <h2>Tula Riot</h2>
            <p>The Tulsa riot is another notorious instance of violence against the African American community that displaced and economically impaired the community. Despite the Jim crow laws and racism. There were over a thousand black-owned businesses. The violence was sparked in retaliation for the alleged rape of a white woman by a black man. The white mob, burned buildings, murdered black residents, and looted hoomes and businesses.<br><img src="./TulsaRaceRiot-1921.png" alt="Tula Riot"> </p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFeYALUqPSk" target="_blank">The Nght Tulsa Burned</a>
