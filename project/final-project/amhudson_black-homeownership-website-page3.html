                        <p>In the building of an integrated neighborhood in Milpitas California, the local government prevented Africa-Americans from using or building on land by declaring plots parklands. Not only that, roads that lead to African American communities were made private and then local government increased the rates for utilities.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, local governments rerouted interstate highways to create boundaries or shift those that encamped African Americans neighborhoods. Equally as important, legislators selected specific school sites to force families to live in segregated neighborhoods to give their children an education. </p><br>

                        <p>Neighborhoods with mostly black residents were redlined and lenders were five times more likely to give loans to white borrowers rather than black borrowers because of these redlined communities. Being in a redlined ditstict affected residents even if they had a high income. As an example, Michael Lomax, a black Fulton County Commission chairman had to go to 3 banks before he could get a loan. In essence, loans were granted based on the borrowerâ€™s ethnicity rather than their income.</p>

                        <p>Labeled as D5, Townsend Street was described as being infiltrated by Jewish and Negro families. It was also noted for its mix of nationalities. Townsend was also labelled as a bad investment because the neighborhood was "old, congested and in disrepair with some vandalism". Also, it was undesirable because of the class of occupants. Unsurprisingly, the house values also went down.</p>
