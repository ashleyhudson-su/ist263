                        <h2>De Facto Segregation</h2>
                        <p>De facto segregation alludes to segregation that was not produced or exacerbated by legislations. The government's involvement in creating a segregated nation are evident in the laws and regulations that have limited housing opportunities for African-Americans and other people of color. It is often argued that racial isolation is primarily a result of residential patterns and preferences and not laws.</p>
                        <p>Athough it is true that people tend to live in communities of their race or ethnicity, it is important to ask why. Research has shown that the answer is not as simple as preference. For instance, some research reveals that discriminatory lending and racism has influenced people's choice. </p>

                        <h2>De Jure Segregation</h2>
                         <p>De jure segregation is segregation influenced by federal, state or local government action. For example, there are cases of interstate highways that were built through neighborhoods, which not only displaced community members but also their businesses and community network. Forms of De Jure Segregation are advertised with the objective to improve communities or cater to some need however, these efforts have historically proven to harm and exclude black communities and other communities of color.  </p>

                        <p>Tactics like segregation and the refusal of developers to sell or rent houses to African Americans left African Americans without the ability to accumulate wealth as homeowners and affected their access to jobs and schools. Practices of segregation concentrated black and other people of color away from white neighborhoods from properly funded schools, public services, well contructed housing, or opportunities for jobs. It is important to note that the high-interest rates of subprime mortgage loans that targeted black communities made it  more difficult to maintain their homes after the housing market crash. Hence, data shows that black homeowners were experiencing more foreclosures after the housing crash.</p>

                        <p>The data depicts that black and Hispanic people are less likely to receive morgages with low interest rates but are more likely to receive mortgages with high interest rates.</p>
                        <p>For instance, 6% of black people who received morgage loans paid less than 3% in interest compared to white, hispanic and asian borrowers who received  8%, 9%, and 12% consecutivley. Additionally, 23% of black people and 18% of Hispanics paid more than 6% in interest compared to whites (14%) and Asians (6%).</p>
