                        <p>De facto segregation is segregation that is not caused by government involvement. These involvements usaally materialize in the form of laws and regulations or government influence. A common argument is that racial isolation is a result of residential patterns and preferences and not a law put in place</p>
                        <p>However de facto segregation is a myth although people and policy makers use it an an escuse not to address systemic racism in America. </p>

                        <p>Tactics like segregation and the refusal of developers to sell or rent houses to African Americans left African Americans without the ability to accumulate wealth as homeowners and affected their access to jobs or schools. Practices of segregation made living further from white neighborhoods and away from better-funded schools, public services, proper housing, or good jobs. The high-interest rate of subprime mortgage loans that targeted black communities made it difficult to maintain their homes after the housing market crash and therefore bore the brunt of foreclosures.</p>
