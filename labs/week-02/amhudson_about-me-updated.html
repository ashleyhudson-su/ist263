    </body>
            <p>My name is Ashley and I am a <strong>Policy Studies</strong> major at Syracuse University. I am a member of the Orange Nation, a mentoring organization at Syracuse University. </p> 
        
            <p>In my role as their community service advisor, I <em>pursued and communicated</em> with community partners like Girlâ€™s Trek, Good Life Foundation, and Imagine Initiative to collaborate on their community service events. Through <abbr title="Orange Nation">ON</abbr>, I also mentored <em>middle school and high school students</em> to prepare <strong>future leaders</strong> and engage young  people <u>inn</u> discussions about self and community development. </p>

            <p>What I learned from my mentees</p>

                <li>We are more capable than we think</li>
